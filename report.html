        After showing my client, Duncan the President of KDR, the website he was very happy with all the pages. The main goal for 
        the site was to give alumni and parents who do not have social media, like instagram, to see and look at what this specific 
        chapter of KDR does and also display the contact information of brothers who hold important positions in the fraternity 
        and to direct people to various links for fundraisers and to redirect them to the national fraternity's website. 
        His only critique was that the alumni page should have a little more than a donation link and a slideshow of pictures, 
        however the Alumni Chair, Noah, thought that it was fine. Other than that he thought that it acomplished what he wanted out of a chapter website.
