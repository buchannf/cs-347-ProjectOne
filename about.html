                <h1>Credo of Kappa Delta Rho</h1>
                <p>
                    Since the Beginning, wherever men have come
                    together, there have I been.
                </p>
                    
                    ​
                <p> 
                    My membership is legion.  From the humble
                    home and from the stately mansion; from the 
                    rolling farms and from the noisy factories;
                    from the East and West and North and South
                    have my followers come.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    They who understand my meaning have followed
                    in the footsteps of the Man of Galilee.  In
                    peace, they have been their brother’s keeper,
                    and in the agony of war, their blood has
                    enriched the Fields of Flanders and reddened
                    the sands of the Pacific.
                </p>    ​
                <p>
                    Their reward has been the Inspiration of
                    their Youth; the Driving Power of their
                    Manhood; the Memories of their Maturity.  They
                    have fought the good Fight and of these, my
                    sons, I am justly proud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Who am I?  My name is FRATERNITY.  And because
                    I have given Man that which he craves, I shall
                    endure.  My sons shall neither falter nor fail.
                    They shall add new lustre to my name.
                </p>
