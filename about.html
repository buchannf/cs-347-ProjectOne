                <p>
                    Since the Beginning, wherever men have come
                    together, there have I been.
                </p>
                    
                    ​
                <p> 
                    My membership is legion.  From the humble
                    home and from the stately mansion; from the 
                    rolling farms and from the noisy factories;
                    from the East and West and North and South
                    have my followers come.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    They who understand my meaning have followed
                    in the footsteps of the Man of Galilee.  In
                    peace, they have been their brother’s keeper,
                    and in the agony of war, their blood has
                    enriched the Fields of Flanders and reddened
                    the sands of the Pacific.
                </p>    ​
                <p>
                    Their reward has been the Inspiration of
                    their Youth; the Driving Power of their
                    Manhood; the Memories of their Maturity.  They
                    have fought the good Fight and of these, my
                    sons, I am justly proud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Who am I?  My name is FRATERNITY.  And because
                    I have given Man that which he craves, I shall
                    endure.  My sons shall neither falter nor fail.
                    They shall add new lustre to my name.
                </p>

                <p>Kappa Delta Rho was founded in room 14 of Old Painter Hall at Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont on May 17, 1905.
                      The founders of Kappa Delta Rho chose to create their own new fraternity, despite other fraternities on campus at the time.
                      Kappa Delta Rho was the creation of a group of men from the Middlebury Commons Club by ten principal founders: 
                      George Edwin Kimball, Irving Thurston Coates, John Beecher, Pierce Wordsworth Darrow, Thomas Howard Bartley, Benjamin Edward Farr, 
                      Gideon Russell Norton, Gino Arturo Ratti, Chester Monroe Walch and Roy Dyer Wood.
                </p>
                <p>Here at James Madison the original Lambda Beta Chapter was created in 1990 fololowing a large expansion of chapters that 
                    the National fraternity was under going at the time. As time went on and the 2000s came along things were looking good. Until 
                    for various reasons the Lambda Beta chaper was kicked off campus in 2000 / 2001 (dates varry) from brother to brother.
                    It was until 2014 did the Lambda Beta Chapter come back to James Madison with the intention of upholding the old tradions of KDR as well as making new ones. 
                    The undergraduate brothers love preserving the history of both sides of the Lambda Beta chapter and are looking forward to the better times ahead.
                    As Gentlemen of Kappa Delta Rho, we are happy to bring our values to James Madison, placing honor above all things.
